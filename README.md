Purpose and Scope
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Multi-Tenant Authentication System, a Spring Boot application that implements JWT-based authentication and authorization across multiple tenant organizations. The system enables secure user management, role-based access control, and tenant isolation within a single application instance.

This overview covers the system's core architecture, key components, and technology stack. For detailed security implementation, see Security & Authentication. For tenant-specific functionality, see Multi-Tenant Management. For user management operations, see User Management.

System Overview
The Multi-Tenant Authentication System is built as a RESTful Spring Boot application that provides authentication and user management services across multiple tenant organizations. The system implements tenant isolation at the data and service layers while maintaining a unified security framework.

Core Features
Feature	Description
Multi-Tenant Architecture	Supports multiple organizations with data isolation
JWT Authentication	Stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens
Role-Based Access Control	Three-tier role system (SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, USER)
RESTful API	Complete REST endpoints for authentication and user management
Spring Security Integration	Comprehensive security configuration with custom filters


Technology Stack
The system is built using the following core technologies:

Component	Technology	Version
Framework	Spring Boot	3.5.5
Security	Spring Security	Latest
Persistence	Spring Data JPA	Latest
Database	PostgreSQL	Latest
Authentication	JWT (jjwt)	0.11.5
Build Tool	Maven	Latest
Java Version	OpenJDK	21

Entity Relationship Model





Multi-Tenant Access Control
The system implements a hierarchical role-based access control system with tenant-scoped permissions:

Role	Scope	Permissions
SUPER_ADMIN	Global	All operations across all tenants
ADMIN	Tenant-Scoped	User management within their tenant
USER	Limited	Access to their own tenant information
Authentication Flow
The system uses JWT tokens for stateless authentication with the following components:

JwtTokenProvider - Generates and validates JWT tokens
JwtAuthenticationFilter - Intercepts requests and validates tokens
AuthServiceImpl - Handles user authentication and registration
SecurityConfig - Configures Spring Security filter chain


API Structure
The system exposes RESTful endpoints organized by functional domains:

Endpoint Pattern	Controller	Purpose
/api/auth/**	AuthController	User registration and authentication
/api/users/**	UserController	User management operations
/api/tenants/**	TenantController	Tenant management operations
Public endpoints (/api/auth/**) allow unauthenticated access for login and registration, while protected endpoints require valid JWT tokens and appropriate role permissions.



Development Environment
The application is configured as a standard Maven project with Spring Boot conventions:

Main application class: MultiTenantAuthSystemApplication
Java version: 21
Maven wrapper included for build consistency
Lombok integration for reduced boilerplate code
Spring Boot DevTools for development productivity
The system uses PostgreSQL as the primary database and Spring Data JPA for data persistence with automatic schema management.
